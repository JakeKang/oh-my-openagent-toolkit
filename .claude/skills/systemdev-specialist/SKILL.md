## Deep Thinking Protocol

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: systemdev-specialist MUST use Sequential Thinking MCP + ultrathink for ALL specialized system architecture decisions. Performance optimization and resource efficiency are non-negotiable.

### Why MANDATORY for System Development Specialist

Specialized systems (AI/ML, GPU computing, video processing) have **zero tolerance for trial-and-error**. Wrong architecture choices in ML model selection, GPU memory management, or video pipeline design result in catastrophic performance issues that cannot be fixed through incremental optimization. These systems require upfront, deeply-analyzed architectural decisions.

**Impact**: A poorly-chosen ML architecture or GPU strategy can make project requirements impossible to meet, requiring complete system redesign.

### When to Apply Deep Thinking

**ALWAYS Required for**:
- **ML Model Architecture Selection**: Choosing model type (transformer, CNN, RNN, hybrid) for specific use case
- **Computer Vision Pipeline Design**: Image preprocessing chain, feature extraction strategy, analysis algorithm selection
- **Spatial Analysis Architecture**: Graph representation, connectivity analysis, topological analysis approach
- **Document/Blueprint Analysis Strategy**: Element detection approach, structural extraction, domain-specific parsing
- **GPU Optimization Strategy**: Memory management, batch sizing, parallelization approach
- **Video Processing Pipeline Design**: Codec selection, frame processing architecture, real-time constraints
- **Distributed Computing Architecture**: Multi-GPU, multi-node coordination strategies
- **Data Pipeline Optimization**: ETL architecture for high-throughput scenarios
- **3D Rendering Architecture**: Scene graph design, rendering pipeline, shader optimization
- **Inference Optimization**: Model quantization, pruning, distillation strategies
- **Real-time Processing Constraints**: Meeting latency requirements while maintaining quality
- **Resource Allocation**: CPU-GPU balance, memory hierarchy optimization
- **Framework Selection**: PyTorch vs TensorFlow, CUDA vs OpenCL, FFmpeg vs GStreamer, OpenCV vs scikit-image

**Standard Protocol Exemptions**:
- Standard data preprocessing (well-established patterns)
- Simple inference code (model already selected)

### Deep Thinking Application Protocol

Follow the 5-Phase approach with SystemDev-specific focus:

#### 1. Problem Framing (1-2 thoughts)
**SystemDev-specific questions**:
- What are the performance requirements (latency, throughput, accuracy)?
- What hardware constraints exist (GPU memory, CPU cores, bandwidth)?
- What is the data scale (volume, velocity, variety)?
- What are the real-time vs batch processing requirements?
- What is the acceptable accuracy-performance tradeoff?

#### 2. Alternative Generation (2-4 thoughts)
**SystemDev-specific alternatives**:
- Research state-of-art approaches (papers, benchmarks)
- Consider both cutting-edge and proven-stable options
- Evaluate commercial vs open-source solutions
- Include hybrid approaches (e.g., ensemble models)
- Use Context7 MCP for latest ML/GPU documentation

#### 3. Multi-Dimensional Evaluation (3-6 thoughts)
**SystemDev-specific evaluation dimensions**:
- **Performance** (30%): Latency, throughput, accuracy metrics
- **Resource Usage** (25%): GPU memory, CPU, bandwidth, power
- **Scalability** (20%): Can handle 10x, 100x data/users?
- **Accuracy/Quality** (15%): Meets domain-specific requirements?
- **Implementation Complexity** (10%): Development and maintenance cost

Create benchmarks, run profiling tests if possible, document assumptions.

#### 4. Decision Synthesis (2-3 thoughts)
**SystemDev-specific criteria**:
- Performance must meet hard requirements (non-negotiable)
- Resource usage must fit hardware budget
- Accuracy must satisfy user expectations
- Balance: Sometimes 95% accuracy at 10ms beats 98% accuracy at 100ms

Document performance predictions with confidence intervals, plan fallback strategies.

#### 5. Implementation Strategy (2-4 thoughts)
**SystemDev-specific considerations**:
- Benchmark before full implementation
- Optimize critical path first (Amdahl's Law)
- Set up profiling and monitoring
- Document optimization assumptions for future review

**Expected Thought Investment**: 15-25 thoughts for typical SystemDev architectural decisions

### Documentation Requirements

All decisions MUST be documented in `.memory/decisions.md`. See CLAUDE.md Deep Thinking Protocol section for full template. Include benchmark results when available.

### Domain-Specific Examples

#### Example 1: ML Model Selection for Real-time Object Detection

**Problem**: Select ML model for real-time object detection in video stream (30 FPS, 1080p, 95%+ accuracy)

**Complexity**: Very High (5 indicators: Multiple approaches, Performance critical, Long-term implications, Novel domain, High cost of failure)

**Deep Thinking Process**:
- Thoughts 1-2: Requirements framing - 30 FPS = 33ms per frame, GPU: RTX 3090 (24GB), accuracy >95%
- Thoughts 3-7: Alternatives - YOLOv8, EfficientDet, Faster R-CNN, RT-DETR, custom hybrid
- Thoughts 8-15: Benchmark existing models, evaluate latency-accuracy tradeoff
- Thoughts 16-18: Decision synthesis based on real benchmark data
- Thoughts 19-22: Optimization strategy - TensorRT, batch processing, async pipeline

**Decision**: YOLOv8-Large with TensorRT optimization

**Rationale**: Benchmark showed 18ms latency (within 33ms budget), 96.3% mAP. GPU memory: 3.2GB. TensorRT reduces latency by 40%. Proven production stability.

**Impact**: Achieved 32 FPS at 96.1% accuracy in production, 2ms under budget enables future features.

#### Example 2: GPU Memory Optimization for Large Batch Training

**Problem**: Train large language model (7B parameters) on single A100 GPU (40GB memory)

**Complexity**: Very High (4 indicators: Multiple approaches, Performance critical, Resource constraints, Novel techniques)

**Deep Thinking Process**:
- Thoughts 1-2: Problem framing - Model: 7B params × 4 bytes = 28GB, Gradients: 28GB, Activations: variable
- Thoughts 3-6: Alternatives - Gradient checkpointing, Mixed precision, LoRA, Model parallelism
- Thoughts 7-13: Memory-performance tradeoff analysis for each approach
- Thoughts 14-16: Combination strategy decision
- Thoughts 17-20: Implementation plan with fallback options

**Decision**: Gradient checkpointing + BF16 mixed precision + LoRA (r=8)

**Rationale**: Gradient checkpointing saves 60% activation memory, 25% compute overhead. BF16 saves 50% model memory. LoRA trains only 0.5% of parameters. Combined: Model fits in 22GB, batch size 32.

**Impact**: Successfully trained on single GPU, saved $15K in multi-GPU infrastructure.

#### Example 3: Architectural Floor Plan Analysis Pipeline

**Problem**: Design CV pipeline to analyze architectural floor plans - extract walls, doors, windows, and generate spatial connectivity graph

**Complexity**: Very High (5 indicators: Multiple approaches, Domain-specific knowledge, Accuracy critical, Novel techniques, Cross-skill dependencies)

**Deep Thinking Process**:
- Thoughts 1-3: Requirements framing - Input: floor plan images (PNG/JPEG), Output: JSON with walls/doors/rooms + adjacency graph, Accuracy target: >90% wall detection, >85% door detection
- Thoughts 4-8: Alternatives analysis:
  - Traditional CV: Preprocessing → Edge detection → Hough Transform → Contour analysis
  - Deep Learning: U-Net segmentation → Post-processing
  - Hybrid: Traditional preprocessing + ML classification
- Thoughts 9-14: Evaluate accuracy, speed, training data requirements, generalization
- Thoughts 15-18: Pipeline architecture decision - Hybrid approach selected
- Thoughts 19-22: Spatial graph algorithm selection - NetworkX with custom room detection

**Decision**: Hybrid CV Pipeline
```

Preprocessing (OpenCV)
├── Grayscale conversion
├── Gaussian blur (noise reduction)
├── Adaptive thresholding
└── Morphological operations (closing gaps)

Wall Detection (Hough Line Transform)
├── Line detection
├── Line merging (close parallel lines)
└── Wall thickness estimation
    ↓
Element Detection (ML-assisted)
├── Door detection (contour + ML classifier)
├── Window detection (pattern matching)

Room Segmentation (Flood Fill + Connected Components)
├── Identify enclosed regions
├── Calculate room properties (area, centroid)
└── Room type classification

Spatial Graph Construction (NetworkX)
├── Nodes: rooms (id, type, area, centroid)
├── Edges: connections (door, opening)
└── Graph metrics (connectivity, integration)
    ↓
JSON Output + Visualization
```

**Rationale**:
- **Hybrid approach**: Traditional CV handles geometric primitives (lines, contours) efficiently without training data. ML assists with complex element classification (door vs window).
- **Hough Transform for walls**: Architectural drawings have clean lines, Hough Transform achieves >95% line detection. Post-processing merges parallel lines into walls.
- **Flood Fill for rooms**: Enclosed region detection is deterministic after wall extraction. No ML training required.
- **NetworkX for graph**: Mature library with built-in graph algorithms. Easy to compute connectivity, shortest paths, centrality measures.

**Impact**: Achieved 92% wall detection accuracy, 87% door detection accuracy. Processing time: <5 seconds for standard floor plan. Spatial graph enables Space Syntax analysis (integration, connectivity).

### Quality Validation

After Deep Thinking, validate:
- [ ] Performance requirements quantified (not vague)
- [ ] Benchmark data collected for top 3 alternatives
- [ ] Resource constraints explicitly checked
- [ ] Accuracy-performance tradeoff explicitly reasoned
- [ ] Profiling plan established
- [ ] Fallback strategy documented if targets missed

Coordinate with **quality-controller** for performance validation checkpoints.

### Integration with SystemDev Workflow
