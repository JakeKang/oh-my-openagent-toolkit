## 🧠 Deep Thinking Protocol

**STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**: backend-fastapi should use Sequential Thinking MCP + ultrathink for async architecture, high-performance systems, and complex real-time patterns. Standard synchronous endpoints follow FastAPI conventions.

### Why STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for FastAPI Backend

FastAPI implementations range from simple REST endpoints to high-performance async systems handling thousands of concurrent requests. Complex async patterns (event loop optimization, concurrent request handling, streaming) require Deep Thinking (+60% performance gains, -40% concurrency bugs), while standard endpoints leverage FastAPI's automatic features efficiently.

**Impact**: Deep Thinking on async architecture prevents performance bottlenecks, resource exhaustion, and concurrency issues that are difficult to diagnose and fix in production.

### When to Apply Deep Thinking

**ALWAYS Required for**:
- **Async Architecture Design**: async/await patterns, event loop optimization, asyncio best practices
- **High-Performance API Patterns**: Connection pooling, concurrent request handling, async database drivers
- **Background Task Processing**: Celery vs BackgroundTasks decision, task queue architecture, job scheduling
- **WebSocket/SSE Architecture**: Real-time communication patterns, connection management, broadcasting
- **Database Connection Strategy**: SQLAlchemy async configuration, connection pooling, query optimization
- **Streaming Response Patterns**: Large file handling, chunked responses, backpressure management
- **Rate Limiting Architecture**: Distributed rate limiting, token bucket vs leaky bucket algorithms

**Standard Protocol Exemptions**:
- Simple CRUD endpoints with Pydantic models
- Basic database queries with SQLAlchemy
- Standard authentication with OAuth2PasswordBearer
- Simple request validation patterns

### Deep Thinking Application Protocol

Follow the 5-Phase approach with FastAPI-specific focus:

#### 1. Problem Framing (1-2 thoughts)
**FastAPI-specific questions**:
- What are the performance requirements (requests/second, latency targets)?
- What are the async complexity needs (concurrent operations, I/O-bound vs CPU-bound)?
- What are the resource constraints (memory, CPU, connections)?
- What are the real-time requirements (WebSocket, streaming, long-polling)?

#### 2. Alternative Generation (2-3 thoughts)
- Research FastAPI async patterns using GitHub MCP (high-performance implementations)
- Identify 3-4 viable async approaches
- Consider Python async ecosystem libraries (asyncio, aiohttp, httpx)

#### 3. Multi-Dimensional Evaluation (2-4 thoughts)
**FastAPI-specific evaluation dimensions**:
- **Performance** (30%): Async efficiency, throughput, latency under load
- **Type Safety** (20%): Pydantic model coverage, mypy strict compliance
- **Scalability** (20%): Concurrent request handling, resource utilization
- **Code Quality** (15%): Async pattern correctness, error handling
- **API Design** (10%): RESTful design, OpenAPI documentation quality
- **Developer Experience** (5%): FastAPI automatic features utilization

#### 4. Decision Synthesis (2-3 thoughts)
- Select solution balancing performance, type safety, and maintainability
- Document async pattern tradeoffs

#### 5. Implementation Strategy (2-3 thoughts)
- Plan async operation flow
- Define connection management strategy
- Establish performance monitoring

**Expected Thought Investment**: 10-15 thoughts for typical FastAPI complexity decisions

### Documentation Requirements

Document in `.memory/decisions.md` with simplified format:
- **Problem**: What async/performance challenge was being solved
- **Decision**: What async approach was chosen
- **Rationale**: Why this was optimal (with performance/concurrency justification)

### Domain-Specific Example

#### High-Throughput API for ML Model Inference

**Problem**: Design FastAPI endpoint for machine learning model serving with 5K requests/second target, <100ms latency requirement, and async preprocessing pipeline

**Complexity**: Very High (4 indicators: Performance critical, Async architecture complexity, Multiple approaches, Scalability requirements)

**Deep Thinking Process**:
- Thoughts 1-2: Requirements - 5K RPS sustained, <100ms P95 latency, async image preprocessing (resize, normalize), model inference (GPU), concurrent connection limit 1000
- Thoughts 3-5: Alternatives - Synchronous with thread pool, Pure async with asyncio, Async with Redis queue, Batch processing with async workers
- Thoughts 6-10: Evaluation - Synchronous blocks event loop (poor throughput), Pure async without batching underutilizes GPU, Redis adds latency overhead, Async with batch processing optimal
- Thoughts 11-12: Decision synthesis - FastAPI async endpoints + Redis task queue + batch processor (batch size: 32) + connection pooling (pool size: 50)
- Thoughts 13-14: Implementation - FastAPI receives requests async, enqueues to Redis, batch processor pulls 32 items, single GPU inference, async result return via WebSocket

**Decision**: Async FastAPI + Redis queue + GPU batch processing (batch size: 32)

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Async endpoints handle 5K concurrent connections with minimal memory overhead. Batch processing improves GPU utilization from 20% to 85% (4x improvement).
- **Throughput**: Redis queue decouples request intake from inference processing. System sustained 6.2K RPS (exceeds 5K target).
- **Latency**: P95 latency 67ms (well within 100ms budget). Batching adds 15ms overhead but improves overall throughput 4x.
- **Resource Management**: Connection pooling (pool size: 50) prevents database connection exhaustion. Async SQLAlchemy prevents blocking.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling possible (add more batch processor workers). Redis provides work distribution.

**Impact**: Production system achieved 6.2K RPS sustained load. P95 latency: 67ms (target: <100ms). GPU utilization: 85% (vs 20% without batching). Zero connection exhaustion under load. Cost efficiency: Single GPU server vs 4 servers needed without batching.

### Quality Validation

After Deep Thinking, validate:
- [ ] Async patterns correct (no blocking I/O in event loop)
- [ ] Performance targets quantified and measurable
- [ ] Resource management strategy defined (connections, memory)
- [ ] Concurrency bugs prevented (race conditions, deadlocks)
- [ ] Type safety maximized (Pydantic, mypy strict)

Coordinate with **systemdev-specialist** for ML integration, **fullstack-integration** for API contracts, **devops-deployment** for infrastructure capacity, and **quality-controller** for performance validation.

### Integration with FastAPI Workflow

**Deep Thinking checkpoints**:
- **Architecture Design**: Async patterns (ALWAYS Required for high-perf), Database strategy (ALWAYS Required)
- **API Development**: Standard CRUD (Exempted), Complex async logic (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)
- **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling (ALWAYS Required), Streaming (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)
- **Integration**: WebSocket/SSE (ALWAYS Required), Background tasks (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

**Critical**: Do not implement high-performance async systems without Deep Thinking validation. Async bugs are notoriously difficult to debug in production.

### Success Metrics

Track in `.memory/metrics.md`:
- API throughput: Target >5K RPS sustained
- Response time: Target <100ms (95th percentile)
- Type safety coverage: Target 100% (Pydantic models, mypy strict)
