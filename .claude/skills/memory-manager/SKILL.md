# Memory Manager - Project Context & Session Continuity

**Purpose**: Manage the hybrid memory-logging system that combines real-time active state management (.memory/ folder) with historical audit trails and analysis (.logs/ folder).

## Hybrid Memory-Logging System

This skill implements a sophisticated dual-system approach:

### Memory System (Real-Time Active State)
**Location**: `.memory/` folder
**Purpose**: Immediate context restoration and active project state
**Functions**:
- Immediate context restoration after session breaks
- Expert coordination and task assignment
- Active quality gate validation
- Current performance monitoring
- Real-time collaboration tracking

### Logging System (Historical Analysis)
**Location**: `.logs/` folder
**Purpose**: Historical audit trails and trend analysis
**Functions**:
- Performance trend analysis and optimization planning
- Expert productivity analysis and recommendations
- Quality improvement tracking and pattern analysis
- Audit trails and compliance reporting
- Long-term learning and optimization

### Integration Approach
**Hybrid Complementary System**:
- Memory updates automatically trigger log entries
- Log analysis feeds back into memory optimization
- Both systems work together for comprehensive project management

## Deep Thinking Protocol

**OPTIONAL**: memory-manager Deep Thinking is rarely needed. 99% of memory operations follow clear templates and structured file operations. Use Deep Thinking only for rare edge cases involving novel memory structures or complex integration patterns not covered by existing templates.

### Rare Use Cases for Deep Thinking

**Consider Deep Thinking only when**:
- **Novel Memory Structure Design**: Entirely new memory architecture not template-based (e.g., distributed memory system, custom integration with external context stores)
- **Complex Memory-Logging Integration**: Custom integration triggers beyond standard memory update → log entry patterns
- **Multi-Project Memory Management**: Novel patterns for managing shared context across multiple related projects
- **Performance-Critical Memory Strategy**: Optimizing memory operations for very large projects (>10K files, >100MB memory state)

**Do NOT use for** (99% of cases - standard operations):
- Standard memory file updates (active-context.md, decisions.md, collaboration.log.md, etc.)
- Session history recording (follows clear template)
- Standard logging integration (auto-triggered from memory-logging-integration.yaml)
- File manifest updates (straightforward CRUD)
- Project initialization with existing templates
- Context restoration (follows structured protocol)
- All standard CRUD operations on memory files

### Complexity Threshold

Use Deep Thinking only when:
1. **No existing template** covers the memory structure needed
2. **Custom integration logic** required (not in memory-logging-integration.yaml)
3. **Multi-project coordination** with shared memory context
4. **Performance optimization** for extreme-scale projects (>10K files)

**Expected Scenarios**: <1% of memory-manager invocations (most projects use standard templates)

### Deep Thinking Application Protocol

Follow the 5-Phase approach with memory-manager-specific focus:

**Evaluation Dimensions**:
- **Clarity** (30%): Memory structure clarity for human developers
- **Efficiency** (25%): File operation performance, storage optimization
- **Maintainability** (20%): Ease of updates, template consistency
- **Session Continuity** (15%): Context restoration reliability
- **Integration** (10%): Logging and cross-skill coordination

**Expected Thought Investment**: 5-8 thoughts for rare novel memory patterns

### Documentation Requirements

Document in `.memory/decisions.md` with minimal format:
- **Problem**: What novel memory challenge was encountered
- **Decision**: What memory structure/pattern was created

**Example** (Brief - Rare Scenario):

**Problem**: Design memory structure for distributed AI model training coordination across 4 geographic regions with separate model versions and training state synchronization

**Complexity**: Medium (1 indicator: Novel domain - distributed training memory not covered by templates)

**Decision**: Regional memory shards (.memory/regions/{region-id}/) with centralized coordination file (.memory/coordination.json) and sync protocol

**Rationale**: Standard single-project memory insufficient for distributed training. Regional shards reduce latency for local teams (Asia, Europe, US-East, US-West). Centralized coordination.json tracks version consistency and synchronization state across regions.

**Impact**: Enabled distributed training with <5s sync latency. Each region maintains local context. Zero conflicts from 300+ daily memory updates across 4 regions.

### Quality Validation

After Deep Thinking (rare cases), validate:
- [ ] Memory structure documented clearly in .memory/ README
- [ ] Template created for reuse if pattern generalizable
- [ ] Integration with logging system maintained
- [ ] Session continuity tested (restore context from new structure)

Coordinate with **pm-orchestrator** for project-wide memory strategies and **quality-controller** for memory quality standards validation.

### Success Metrics

Track in `.memory/metrics.md` (only when Deep Thinking applied):
- Template coverage: Target >95% (how many projects use standard templates)
- Context restoration success: Target 100% (restore works reliably)
- Memory operation efficiency: Target <100ms for standard operations

## Core Memory Files

## Memory-Logging Integration Triggers

### Automatic Integration (from memory-logging-integration.yaml)

**Memory Update → Log Entry**:
- Expert memory file update → Expert log entry
- Quality metrics update → Quality log entry
- Collaboration event → Collaboration log entry
- Performance change → Performance log entry

**Log Analysis → Memory Optimization**:
- Daily log analysis → Memory improvement recommendations
- Expert productivity analysis → Expert memory enhancements
- Quality trends → Memory-based quality strategy updates
- Performance insights → Memory optimization guidance

## Memory System Operations

### 1. Project Initialization

When invoked for a new project:

```
1. Read memory-templates.yaml to get project-type template
2. Create .memory/ directory
3. Create core memory files with template content:
   - active-context.md
   - decisions.md
   - collaboration.log.md
   - project-state.json
   - session-history.json
   - artifacts.manifest.json

4. Create project-specific memory files based on detected type
5. Create expert-specific memory files for active skills
6. Initialize .logs/ directory structure
7. Configure memory-logging integration triggers
8. Output: "Memory system initialized for {project_type}"
```

### 2. Context Update

When skills need to update project state:

```
1. Receive update request with content and target file
2. Edit appropriate memory file (e.g., .memory/active-context.md)
3. Update timestamp and change history
4. Trigger automatic log entry in corresponding .logs/ file
5. Output confirmation of update
```

### 3. Session Restoration

When resuming a project after a break:

```
1. Read .memory/project-state.json for project metadata
2. Read .memory/active-context.md for current status
3. Read .memory/session-history.json for last session details
4. Provide comprehensive context summary:
   - Project type and current phase
   - Last completed tasks
   - Current active tasks
   - Next planned milestones
   - Any blockers or issues
5. Analyze .logs/ for historical insights
6. Output: "Context restored. Project {name} at {phase}. Last activity: {summary}"
```

### 4. Pre-Session Preservation

Before session ends or context compression:

```
1. Update all active memory files with current state
2. Edit .memory/session-history.json with session summary
3. Update .memory/project-state.json with latest metrics
4. Record any pending tasks in .memory/active-context.md
5. Ensure all expert-specific memory files are current
6. Create session log entry in .logs/sessions/
7. Output: "Context preserved. Session recorded."
```

## Template System

Uses **memory-templates.yaml** which contains:

- **core_templates**: Standard memory file templates for all projects
- **project_type_templates**: Project-specific memory structures
- **expert_memory_templates**: Expert domain-specific templates

3. **Track Changes**: Note what changed and why in update records
4. **Maintain Relationships**: Link decisions to requirements and impacts
5. **Preserve Context**: Include enough context for future restoration
6. **Use Timestamps**: Always timestamp changes for historical analysis
