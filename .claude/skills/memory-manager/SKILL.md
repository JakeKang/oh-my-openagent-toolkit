# Memory Manager - Project Context & Session Continuity

**Purpose**: Manage the hybrid memory-logging system that combines real-time active state management (.memory/ folder) with historical audit trails and analysis (.logs/ folder).

## Hybrid Memory-Logging System

This skill implements a sophisticated dual-system approach:

### Memory System (Real-Time Active State)
**Location**: `.memory/` folder
**Purpose**: Immediate context restoration and active project state
**Functions**:
- Immediate context restoration after session breaks
- Expert coordination and task assignment
- Active quality gate validation
- Current performance monitoring
- Real-time collaboration tracking

### Logging System (Historical Analysis)
**Location**: `.logs/` folder
**Purpose**: Historical audit trails and trend analysis
**Functions**:
- Performance trend analysis and optimization planning
- Expert productivity analysis and recommendations
- Quality improvement tracking and pattern analysis
- Audit trails and compliance reporting
- Long-term learning and optimization

### Integration Approach
**Hybrid Complementary System**:
- Memory updates automatically trigger log entries
- Log analysis feeds back into memory optimization
- Both systems work together for comprehensive project management

## Deep Thinking Protocol

**OPTIONAL**: memory-manager Deep Thinking is rarely needed. 99% of memory operations follow clear templates and structured file operations. Use Deep Thinking only for rare edge cases involving novel memory structures or complex integration patterns not covered by existing templates.

### Rare Use Cases for Deep Thinking

**Consider Deep Thinking only when**:
- **Novel Memory Structure Design**: Entirely new memory architecture not template-based (e.g., distributed memory system, custom integration with external context stores)
- **Complex Memory-Logging Integration**: Custom integration triggers beyond standard memory update → log entry patterns
- **Multi-Project Memory Management**: Novel patterns for managing shared context across multiple related projects
- **Performance-Critical Memory Strategy**: Optimizing memory operations for very large projects (>10K files, >100MB memory state)

**Do NOT use for** (99% of cases - standard operations):
- Standard memory file updates (active-context.md, decisions.md, collaboration.log.md, etc.)
- Session history recording (follows clear template)
- Standard logging integration (auto-triggered from memory-logging-integration.yaml)
- File manifest updates (straightforward CRUD)
- Project initialization with existing templates
- Context restoration (follows structured protocol)
- All standard CRUD operations on memory files

### Complexity Threshold

Use Deep Thinking only when:
1. **No existing template** covers the memory structure needed
2. **Custom integration logic** required (not in memory-logging-integration.yaml)
3. **Multi-project coordination** with shared memory context
4. **Performance optimization** for extreme-scale projects (>10K files)

**Expected Scenarios**: <1% of memory-manager invocations (most projects use standard templates)

### Deep Thinking Application Protocol

Follow the 5-Phase approach with memory-manager-specific focus:

**Evaluation Dimensions**:
- **Clarity** (30%): Memory structure clarity for human developers
- **Efficiency** (25%): File operation performance, storage optimization
- **Maintainability** (20%): Ease of updates, template consistency
- **Session Continuity** (15%): Context restoration reliability
- **Integration** (10%): Logging and cross-skill coordination

**Expected Thought Investment**: 5-8 thoughts for rare novel memory patterns

### Documentation Requirements

Document in `.memory/decisions.md` with minimal format:
- **Problem**: What novel memory challenge was encountered
- **Decision**: What memory structure/pattern was created

**Example** (Brief - Rare Scenario):

**Problem**: Design memory structure for distributed AI model training coordination across 4 geographic regions with separate model versions and training state synchronization

**Complexity**: Medium (1 indicator: Novel domain - distributed training memory not covered by templates)

**Decision**: Regional memory shards (.memory/regions/{region-id}/) with centralized coordination file (.memory/coordination.json) and sync protocol

**Rationale**: Standard single-project memory insufficient for distributed training. Regional shards reduce latency for local teams (Asia, Europe, US-East, US-West). Centralized coordination.json tracks version consistency and synchronization state across regions.

**Impact**: Enabled distributed training with <5s sync latency. Each region maintains local context. Zero conflicts from 300+ daily memory updates across 4 regions.

### Quality Validation

After Deep Thinking (rare cases), validate:
- [ ] Memory structure documented clearly in .memory/ README
- [ ] Template created for reuse if pattern generalizable
- [ ] Integration with logging system maintained
- [ ] Session continuity tested (restore context from new structure)

Coordinate with **pm-orchestrator** for project-wide memory strategies and **quality-controller** for memory quality standards validation.

### Success Metrics

Track in `.memory/metrics.md` (only when Deep Thinking applied):
- Template coverage: Target >95% (how many projects use standard templates)
- Context restoration success: Target 100% (restore works reliably)
- Memory operation efficiency: Target <100ms for standard operations

6. Configure production metrics collection integration
7. Set up user feedback collection channels
8. Initialize CI/CD metrics tracking
9. Output: "Continuous development memory initialized - 7 files created"
```

- Reads: user-feedback.md, technical-debt.md, release-plan.md, production-metrics.md
- Updates: release-plan.md (work intake), active-context.md (current work)

**Sub-Workflows** (feature-development, bug-fix, hotfix, enhancement, refactoring, performance-optimization, security-patch, version-upgrade):
- All read: version-history.md (current version), production-metrics.md (baseline)
- All update: version-history.md (after completion via pm-orchestrator)
- Specific updates:
  - bug-fix.md → user-feedback.md (mark bug resolved)
  - hotfix.md → incident-log.md (incident tracking)
  - refactoring.md → technical-debt.md (mark debt resolved)
  - performance-optimization.md → production-metrics.md (performance improvements)

### Memory File Lifecycle

**Creation**: After v1.0.0 release (state transition to continuous_development)

**Active Use**: Throughout continuous development lifecycle (v1.x.x → v2.x.x → v3.x.x)

**Persistence**: Permanent (never deleted, grows over project lifetime)

**Archival**: Monthly summaries archived to `.logs/memory-snapshots/` for historical analysis

**Migration**: When transitioning to major version (v1.x.x → v2.0.0), maintain continuity but start new sections for v2.x.x lifecycle

## Logging System Structure

Create and maintain `.logs/` directory with subdirectories:

### Log Directory Structure
```
.logs/
├── sessions/              # Session-level logs
│   └── session-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.log
├── experts/               # Expert-specific activity logs
│   ├── pm-{YYYYMMDD}.log
│   ├── frontend-{YYYYMMDD}.log
│   ├── backend-{YYYYMMDD}.log
│   └── ... (all experts)
├── collaboration/         # Skill coordination logs
│   ├── collab-requests-{YYYYMMDD}.log
│   └── collab-conversations-{YYYYMMDD}.log
├── quality/              # Quality metrics and validation logs
│   ├── quality-metrics-{YYYYMMDD}.log
│   └── compliance-{YYYYMMDD}.log
├── performance/          # Performance tracking logs
│   └── timing-{YYYYMMDD}.log
├── errors/               # Error and warning logs
│   └── errors-{YYYYMMDD}.log
└── system/               # System event logs

```

## Memory-Logging Integration Triggers

### Automatic Integration (from memory-logging-integration.yaml)

**Memory Update → Log Entry**:
- Expert memory file update → Expert log entry
- Quality metrics update → Quality log entry
- Collaboration event → Collaboration log entry
- Performance change → Performance log entry

**Log Analysis → Memory Optimization**:
- Daily log analysis → Memory improvement recommendations
- Expert productivity analysis → Expert memory enhancements
- Quality trends → Memory-based quality strategy updates
- Performance insights → Memory optimization guidance

## Memory System Operations

### 1. Project Initialization

When invoked for a new project:

```
1. Read memory-templates.yaml to get project-type template
2. Create .memory/ directory
3. Create core memory files with template content:
   - active-context.md
   - decisions.md
   - collaboration.log.md
   - project-state.json
   - session-history.json
   - artifacts.manifest.json

4. Create project-specific memory files based on detected type
5. Create expert-specific memory files for active skills
6. Initialize .logs/ directory structure
7. Configure memory-logging integration triggers
8. Output: "Memory system initialized for {project_type}"
```

### 2. Context Update

When skills need to update project state:

```
1. Receive update request with content and target file
2. Edit appropriate memory file (e.g., .memory/active-context.md)
3. Update timestamp and change history
4. Trigger automatic log entry in corresponding .logs/ file
5. Output confirmation of update
```

### 3. Session Restoration

When resuming a project after a break:

```
1. Read .memory/project-state.json for project metadata
2. Read .memory/active-context.md for current status
3. Read .memory/session-history.json for last session details
4. Provide comprehensive context summary:
   - Project type and current phase
   - Last completed tasks
   - Current active tasks
   - Next planned milestones
   - Any blockers or issues
5. Analyze .logs/ for historical insights
6. Output: "Context restored. Project {name} at {phase}. Last activity: {summary}"
```

### 4. Pre-Session Preservation

Before session ends or context compression:

```
1. Update all active memory files with current state
2. Edit .memory/session-history.json with session summary
3. Update .memory/project-state.json with latest metrics
4. Record any pending tasks in .memory/active-context.md
5. Ensure all expert-specific memory files are current
6. Create session log entry in .logs/sessions/
7. Output: "Context preserved. Session recorded."
```

## Template System

Uses **memory-templates.yaml** which contains:

- **core_templates**: Standard memory file templates for all projects
- **project_type_templates**: Project-specific memory structures
- **expert_memory_templates**: Expert domain-specific templates
- **template_content**: Default content and placeholders for each file

## Integration with Other Skills

### PM Orchestrator
- Requests memory initialization for new projects
- Updates memory with strategic decisions and milestones
- Coordinates memory updates across skills

- Provides detected project type for appropriate memory template selection

### Quality Controller
- Updates quality metrics in memory
- Triggers quality log entries via integration

### Domain Skills (Frontend, Backend, etc.)

- Trigger automatic logging through integration

## Configuration Files

This skill includes:

- **memory-templates.yaml**: All memory templates and structures
- **logging-system.yaml**: Logging configuration and directory structure
- **memory-logging-integration.yaml**: Integration triggers and feedback mechanisms

## Output Guidelines

- Provide clear memory operation confirmations
- Show what was updated: "Updated .memory/active-context.md with architecture decision"
- Indicate triggering integrations: "Triggered log entry in .logs/experts/fullstack-{date}.log"
- Report context restoration status: "Context restored from session-{id}"

## Related Skills

- **pm-orchestrator**: Coordinates memory updates during project execution
- **project-detector**: Provides project type for memory template selection
- **quality-controller**: Integrates quality metrics into memory system
- All domain skills: Update their expert-specific memory files

## Atomic Write Protocol (CRITICAL for Data Integrity)

**Purpose**: Prevent data corruption during concurrent memory operations, especially when multiple skills write to memory files simultaneously.

### Problem: Race Condition Risk

When multiple skills update memory files concurrently:
```
Skill A reads .memory/active-context.md (v1)
Skill B reads .memory/active-context.md (v1)
Skill A writes changes → (v2)
Skill B writes changes (based on v1) → OVERWRITES Skill A's changes!
```

### Solution: Atomic Write Pattern

**MANDATORY for all memory file updates**:

```bash
# Atomic write pattern (temp file → fsync → rename)
1. Write content to temporary file: .memory/.{filename}.tmp
2. Call fsync() to ensure data is flushed to disk
3. Atomic rename: mv .memory/.{filename}.tmp → .memory/{filename}
4. Verify final file exists and is readable
```

### Implementation Protocol

**For Claude Code Write/Edit Operations**:

When updating any `.memory/` file, follow this sequence:

1. **Read Current State**: Always read the latest version before modification
2. **Compute Changes**: Merge your updates with current state
3. **Write Atomically**: Use the pattern below

**Atomic Write Sequence**:
```
# Step 1: Write to temporary file
Write content to: .memory/.{original-filename}.tmp.{timestamp}

# Step 2: Verify temporary file
Read back .memory/.{original-filename}.tmp.{timestamp}
Confirm content matches expected output

# Step 3: Atomic rename (overwrite original)
Rename .memory/.{original-filename}.tmp.{timestamp} → .memory/{original-filename}

# Step 4: Cleanup on success
Temporary file automatically replaced by rename
```

### Lock-Free Conflict Resolution

**When parallel writes occur** (detected by timestamp comparison):

1. **Optimistic Concurrency**: Assume no conflict, proceed with write
2. **Post-Write Validation**: After atomic rename, verify expected state
3. **Conflict Detection**: If final state != expected (another skill wrote):
   - Re-read the current state
   - Merge your changes with the new state
   - Retry atomic write (max 3 retries)
4. **Conflict Resolution**: If conflict persists after retries:
   - Log conflict in `.logs/errors/memory-conflicts-{date}.log`
   - Preserve both versions: `{filename}.conflict.{timestamp}`
   - Alert pm-orchestrator for manual resolution

### File-Level Granularity Guidelines

**To minimize conflicts, use appropriate file granularity**:

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| High-frequency updates (active-context) | Single atomic file, frequent small updates |
| Parallel skill updates | Separate files per skill domain |
| Shared state (project-state.json) | Atomic JSON patches, not full rewrites |
| Append-only data (collaboration.log) | Append-only writes with timestamps |

### Memory File Update Categories

**Category A: Single-Writer Files** (no atomic complexity needed):
- `.memory/session-history.json` - memory-manager only
- `.memory/artifacts.manifest.json` - memory-manager only

**Category B: Multi-Writer Files** (MUST use atomic pattern):
- `.memory/active-context.md` - All skills update
- `.memory/decisions.md` - Multiple skills record decisions
- `.memory/project-state.json` - Progress updates from many skills
- `.memory/collaboration.log.md` - All skills log interactions

**Category C: Append-Only Files** (atomic append, never overwrite):
- `.logs/**/*.log` - Always append with timestamp, never modify existing

### Validation Checklist

Before completing any memory write operation, verify:
- [ ] Read latest state before modification
- [ ] Temporary file created successfully
- [ ] Atomic rename completed
- [ ] Final file readable and contains expected content
- [ ] No `.tmp.*` files left behind (cleanup)

### Error Recovery

**If atomic write fails**:
1. Check for leftover `.tmp` files → Clean up
2. Verify original file still intact → Preserve
3. Log failure in `.logs/errors/`
4. Retry with fresh read (handle stale state)
5. If persistent failure → Alert pm-orchestrator

## Memory Preservation Best Practices

1. **Update Frequently**: Keep memory current, don't batch updates
2. **Be Specific**: Record specific decisions with rationale, not vague summaries
3. **Track Changes**: Note what changed and why in update records
4. **Maintain Relationships**: Link decisions to requirements and impacts
5. **Preserve Context**: Include enough context for future restoration
6. **Use Timestamps**: Always timestamp changes for historical analysis
7. **Use Atomic Writes**: Follow atomic write protocol for all multi-writer files (CRITICAL)

## Git Repository State Tracking

memory-manager tracks Git repository state as part of the project memory system. This enables session continuity with full Git context.

See: [GIT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.md](../GIT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.md) for complete multi-repository management guidelines.

### Git State in project-state.json

The `git_repositories` field in `.memory/project-state.json` tracks all initialized repositories:

```json
{
  "git_repositories": {
    "shared": {
      "initialized": true,
      "path": "workspace/shared",
      "remote": "https://github.com/user/project-shared",
      "current_branch": "main",
      "last_commit": "abc1234",
      "last_commit_message": "feat(types): add User interface",
      "last_commit_date": "2025-12-18T10:30:00Z",
      "dirty": false
    },
    "frontend": {
      "initialized": true,
      "path": "workspace/frontend",
      "remote": "https://github.com/user/project-frontend",
      "current_branch": "develop",
      "last_commit": "def5678",
      "last_commit_message": "feat(auth): add login page",
      "last_commit_date": "2025-12-18T11:00:00Z",
      "dirty": true
    },
    "backend": {
      "initialized": true,
      "path": "workspace/backend",
      "remote": null,
      "current_branch": "main",
      "last_commit": "ghi9012",
      "last_commit_message": "feat(users): add user module",
      "last_commit_date": "2025-12-18T10:45:00Z",
      "dirty": false
    },
    "mobile": {
      "initialized": false,
      "path": "workspace/mobile",
      "remote": null,
      "current_branch": null,
      "last_commit": null,
      "last_commit_message": null,
      "last_commit_date": null,
      "dirty": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Git State Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `initialized` | boolean | Whether `git init` has been run |
| `path` | string | Relative path to repository root |
| `remote` | string/null | Remote origin URL (null if not set) |
| `current_branch` | string/null | Current checked-out branch |
| `last_commit` | string/null | Short hash of last commit |
| `last_commit_message` | string/null | Last commit message |
| `last_commit_date` | ISO8601/null | Timestamp of last commit |
| `dirty` | boolean | Whether there are uncommitted changes |

### When to Update Git State

memory-manager updates `git_repositories` when:

| Event | Trigger | Updated Fields |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Repository initialized | pm-orchestrator git init | `initialized`, `path`, `current_branch`, `last_commit` |
| Commit made | Any domain skill commits | `last_commit`, `last_commit_message`, `last_commit_date`, `dirty` |
| Branch changed | Skill switches branch | `current_branch` |
| Remote added | devops-deployment adds remote | `remote` |
| Push completed | Any skill pushes | (verify remote state) |
| Session start | Verify actual git state | All fields (reconcile with filesystem) |

### Git State Update Protocol

**After any Git operation**, the skill that performed the operation requests memory update:

```
1. Skill performs git operation (commit, branch, etc.)
2. Skill requests memory-manager update:
   - Repository name (frontend, backend, mobile, shared)
   - Updated fields
3. memory-manager reads current project-state.json
4. memory-manager updates git_repositories.{repo}
5. memory-manager writes atomically (atomic write protocol)
6. memory-manager logs update in .logs/system/
```

### Git Commands for State Collection

memory-manager uses these commands to verify/collect Git state:

```bash
# Get last commit hash
git rev-parse --short HEAD

# Get last commit message
git log -1 --pretty=%B

# Get last commit date (ISO 8601)
git log -1 --format=%cI

# Check if working directory is dirty
git status --porcelain
# (non-empty output = dirty)

# Get current branch
git branch --show-current

# Get remote URL
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "null"
```

### Session Continuity with Git

**On Session Start**, memory-manager verifies Git state:

```
1. Read .memory/project-state.json → git_repositories
2. For each repository with initialized=true:
   a. Verify .git directory exists
   b. Run git status --porcelain → Check dirty state
   c. Run git branch --show-current → Verify branch
   d. Run git rev-parse --short HEAD → Verify last commit
   e. Compare with stored state
   f. Report discrepancies
3. Update project-state.json if filesystem state differs
4. Report Git summary to pm-orchestrator:
   "Git repositories:
    - frontend (develop): 3 uncommitted changes
    - backend (main): clean
    - shared (main): clean"
```

### Dirty State Detection

**Dirty state** = uncommitted changes exist:

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  echo "dirty=true"
else
  echo "dirty=false"
fi
```

**Report dirty state at session start**:
- Warn user about uncommitted changes
- Suggest commit or stash before major operations
- Track in active-context.md as "uncommitted work"

### Integration with Continuous Development

**During continuous development** (09-continuous-development.md):

```
1. Feature branch created → Update current_branch
2. Each commit → Update last_commit, last_commit_message, last_commit_date
3. Merge to develop → Update current_branch
4. Release tagged → Log in version-history.md + update git state
5. Push to remote → Verify remote sync
```

### Error Handling

**If Git state cannot be determined**:

1. Log error in `.logs/errors/git-state-{date}.log`
2. Mark repository as `needs_verification: true`
3. Alert pm-orchestrator
4. Do NOT overwrite existing state (preserve last known good)

**Recovery**:
```bash
# Reinitialize git state from filesystem
cd workspace/{repo}
git status  # Verify repository is valid
# Re-read all state fields
# Update project-state.json
```
