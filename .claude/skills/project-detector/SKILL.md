# Project Detector - Automatic Project Type Detection

**Purpose**: Automatically detect project type from user requirements and recommend appropriate development skills for the project.

## How Project Detection Works

This skill implements a sophisticated keyword-based scoring algorithm to classify projects into one of 6 types:

1. **web_application**: Web apps, dashboards, websites
2. **ai_ml_system**: AI models, machine learning, data analysis
3. **mobile_application**: Mobile apps (iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter)
4. **api_microservice**: RESTful APIs, GraphQL services, microservices
5. **data_processing_system**: Data pipelines, ETL, big data
6. **desktop_application**: Desktop GUI apps (Electron/Tauri)

## Detection Algorithm

### Scoring System (100 points maximum)
- **Keywords Match**: 40 points
- **Frameworks Match**: 35 points
- **Technologies Match**: 25 points

### Detection Process

1. **Analyze User Request**:
   - Extract keywords from user's project description
   - Convert all text to lowercase for matching
   - Identify mentioned frameworks and technologies

2. **Score Each Project Type**:
   - Match keywords against project_types definitions in project-detection.yaml
   - Calculate weighted score based on matches
   - Minimum threshold: 30 points for valid detection

3. **Select Project Type**:
   - Choose project type with highest score
   - If score < 30: Use fallback type (web_application)
   - Return detected type with confidence score

4. **Recommend Skills**:
   - Based on detected project type, recommend appropriate skills
   - Use auto_experts mapping from project-detection.yaml

## Deep Thinking Protocol

**CONDITIONAL**: project-detector should use Sequential Thinking MCP + ultrathink only when encountering ambiguous, hybrid, or novel project types. Clear project types (>70 score) use standard detection algorithm efficiently.

### When to Apply Deep Thinking

**Use Deep Thinking when**:
- **Ambiguous Project Type**: Scoring <50 points, unclear signals from user description
- **Hybrid Projects**: Multiple project types score >40 (e.g., AI-powered mobile web app)
- **Novel Project Categories**: Project doesn't fit standard 6 types clearly
- **Conflicting Skill Recommendations**: Detected type doesn't match actual technical needs

**Do NOT use for** (most cases - ~90%):
- Clear project type match (>70 score)
- Standard technology stacks clearly mentioned
- Obvious skill requirements
- Projects matching established patterns

### Complexity Threshold

Use Deep Thinking only when:
1. **Project score <50** (ambiguous type detection)
2. **Multiple types score >40** (hybrid project characteristics)
3. **Novel requirements** not matching standard 6 types
4. **Skill recommendation conflicts** with project needs

### Deep Thinking Application Protocol

Follow the 5-Phase approach with project-detector-specific focus:

**Evaluation Dimensions**:
- **Accuracy** (40%): Correct project type detection
- **Skill Recommendation Quality** (30%): Appropriate team assembly
- **Ambiguity Resolution** (20%): Handling unclear requirements
- **Speed** (10%): Quick detection for clear cases

**Expected Thought Investment**: 8-12 thoughts for ambiguous project detection

### Documentation Requirements

Document in `.memory/decisions.md` with minimal format:
- **Problem**: What project type ambiguity encountered
- **Decision**: What type and skills chosen

### Domain-Specific Example

#### Hybrid AI Video Platform with Multi-Platform Apps

**Problem**: Detect project type for "AI-powered video processing platform with real-time collaborative editing, iOS/Android mobile apps, and desktop app for professionals with GPU acceleration"

**Complexity**: Very High (Multiple types score high: ai_ml_system 65, mobile_application 55, desktop_application 45, web_application 40 - hybrid project)

**Deep Thinking Process**:
- Thoughts 1-2: Analysis - AI/ML video processing (primary), mobile apps (secondary), desktop app (tertiary), real-time web features (supporting)
- Thoughts 3-5: Type scoring validation - AI/ML highest but mobile/desktop significant, not standard single-type
- Thoughts 6-8: Skill requirements analysis - systemdev-specialist (AI/video lead), frontend-nextjs (web), backend-fastapi (async AI serving), research-analysis, devops-deployment
- Thoughts 9-12: Team assembly decision - Lead with AI/ML specialty, support with multi-platform skills

**Decision**: Primary type: **ai_ml_system** (score: 65), Secondary: **mobile_application** (score: 55)

**Recommended Skills**: systemdev-specialist (lead - AI/video processing), frontend-nextjs (web UI), backend-fastapi (async model serving), research-analysis (AI frameworks), devops-deployment (GPU infrastructure), qa-testing

**Rationale**: AI video processing is core value proposition (primary type). Mobile/desktop are delivery platforms (secondary consideration). Skill team reflects this: systemdev-specialist leads with AI/ML/video expertise, backend-fastapi handles async model serving, frontend-nextjs for web interface, research-analysis for framework selection.

**Impact**: Correct detection enabled proper skill team assembly with AI/video expertise leading. Project completed successfully with specialized team. Alternative incorrect detection as "mobile_application" would have missed critical AI/video requirements.

### Quality Validation

After Deep Thinking, validate:
- [ ] Detected type aligns with core project value
- [ ] Skill recommendations cover all technical requirements
- [ ] Hybrid characteristics properly identified
- [ ] Team assembly practical and balanced

Coordinate with **pm-orchestrator** for team assembly approval and **research-analysis** for technology validation when novel requirements identified.

### Success Metrics

Track in `.memory/metrics.md`:
- Detection accuracy: Target >95% (correct type for project)
- Skill recommendation quality: Target >90% (team satisfaction)
- Ambiguity resolution rate: Target >85% (successful hybrid/novel handling)
