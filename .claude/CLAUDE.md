---

## System Overview

This is an autonomous development system consisting of 13 specialized skills that work together through contextual invocation. Unlike traditional explicit-signal-based systems, skills are automatically invoked by Claude based on context matching.

### Core Architecture Principles

**Autonomous Skill Invocation**:
- Skills are invoked based on description matching (no manual commands)
- Cross-skill coordination through natural language mentions
- Zero user confirmation required for all decisions
- Complete project delivery from user request to finished code

**Skills Organization**:
- **4 Infrastructure Skills**: pm-orchestrator, project-detector, memory-manager, quality-controller
- **9 Domain Skills**: frontend-nextjs, backend-nestjs, backend-fastapi, fullstack-integration, systemdev-specialist, devops-deployment, qa-testing, research-analysis, mcp-tools-orchestrator

---

## PHASE 1-4 Project Initialization Protocol

### PHASE 1: Project Type Detection (AUTO-TRIGGERED)

**When**: User provides initial project description
**Primary Skill**: project-detector
**Process**:

1. **Keyword Analysis**:
   - Extract keywords from user request (lowercase conversion)
   - Match against 6 project types: web_application, ai_ml_system, mobile_application, api_microservice, data_processing_system, desktop_application

2. **Scoring Algorithm**:
   - Keywords: 40 points
   - Frameworks: 35 points
   - Technologies: 25 points
   - Minimum threshold: 30 points

3. **Type Selection**:
   - Highest scoring type selected
   - Fallback to web_application if score < 30

4. **Skill Recommendations**:
   - project-detector outputs recommended skills based on detected type
   - pm-orchestrator receives recommendations

**Output**: "Project type: {type} (score: {score}/100), Recommended skills: {skills}"

### PHASE 2: Skill Team Assembly (AUTO-COORDINATED)

**When**: Immediately after project detection
**Primary Skill**: pm-orchestrator
**Process**:

1. **Skill Activation**:
   - pm-orchestrator mentions recommended skills in natural language
   - Example: "The frontend-nextjs skill will handle UI development"
   - Claude automatically invokes mentioned skills

2. **Skill Team by Project Type**:
   - **Web Application**: frontend-nextjs, backend-nestjs OR backend-fastapi, fullstack-integration, qa-testing, devops-deployment
   - **AI/ML System**: systemdev-specialist, research-analysis, backend-nestjs OR backend-fastapi, qa-testing
   - **Mobile App**: frontend-nextjs, backend-nestjs OR backend-fastapi, devops-deployment, qa-testing
   - **API Service**: backend-nestjs OR backend-fastapi, fullstack-integration, devops-deployment, qa-testing
   - **Data Processing**: systemdev-specialist, backend-nestjs OR backend-fastapi, research-analysis, devops-deployment
   - **Desktop App**: frontend-nextjs, systemdev-specialist, devops-deployment, qa-testing

   **Backend Selection Criteria**:
   - **backend-nestjs**: TypeScript full-stack, enterprise architecture, Angular-style DI, GraphQL primary
   - **backend-fastapi**: Python ecosystem, AI/ML integration, async performance, scientific computing

3. **Coordination Matrix**:
   - All skills remain available throughout project lifecycle
   - Skills can mention each other for collaboration
   - pm-orchestrator maintains overall coordination

**Output**: "Activated skills: {skill_list}"

### PHASE 3: Memory System Initialization (AUTO-EXECUTED)

**When**: After team assembly
**Primary Skill**: memory-manager
**Process**:

1. **Memory Structure Creation**:
   - Create `.memory/` directory
   - Initialize core memory files:
     - active-context.md (current project status)
     - decisions.md (decision history)
     - collaboration.log.md (skill coordination)
     - project-state.json (comprehensive metrics)
     - session-history.json (session continuity)
     - artifacts.manifest.json (generated files tracking)

2. **Project-Type-Specific Files**:
   - **Web App**: ui-components.md, api-endpoints.md, user-flows.md, performance-targets.md
   - **AI/ML**: model-architecture.md, data-pipeline.md, training-requirements.md, performance-metrics.md
   - **Mobile**: platform-requirements.md, performance-targets.md
   - **API**: service-architecture.md, endpoint-specifications.md
   - **Data**: data-flow-architecture.md, processing-pipeline.md
   - **Desktop**: platform-integration.md, ui-framework.md

3. **Skill-Specific Memory**:
   - QA: test-coverage.md, quality-metrics.md, security-testing.md, performance-validation.md
   - DevOps: deployment-config.md, infrastructure-state.md, ci-cd-workflows.md, monitoring-metrics.md
   - Research: research-findings.md, technology-analysis.md, market-analysis.md, risk-assessment.md
   - SystemDev: system-performance.md, gpu-optimization.md, infrastructure-scaling.md
   - Frontend: component-library.md, design-system.md, ui-patterns.md
   - Backend: api-documentation.md, database-schema.md, service-architecture.md
   - Fullstack: integration-architecture.md, system-design.md, technology-stack.md
   - MCP: tool-usage-optimization.md, automation-workflows.md, integration-patterns.md

4. **Logging System Initialization**:
   - Create `.logs/` directory structure:
     - sessions/ (session-level logs)
     - skills/ (skill activity logs)
     - collaboration/ (cross-skill coordination)
     - quality/ (quality metrics evolution)
     - performance/ (performance tracking)
     - errors/ (error logs)
     - system/ (system events)

5. **Memory-Logging Integration**:
   - Configure automatic triggers: memory updates → log entries
   - Set up feedback mechanisms: log analysis → memory optimization
   - Activate hybrid complementary system

**Output**: "Memory system initialized for {project_type}"

### PHASE 4: First Task Initiation (AUTO-STARTED)

**When**: After memory initialization
**Primary Skill**: pm-orchestrator
**Process**:

1. **Workflow Selection**:
   - pm-orchestrator references workflows/ directory
   - Selects first workflow: typically "01-requirements-analysis.md"

2. **Task Execution**:
   - pm-orchestrator (or designated skill) begins task
   - Follows workflow steps from workflows/ directory
   - Updates memory system throughout execution

3. **Quality Standards Setup**:
   - pm-orchestrator mentions quality-controller
   - quality-controller establishes project-type-specific standards
   - Quality gates configured for continuous validation

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Real-time updates to .memory/active-context.md
   - Collaboration logged in .memory/collaboration.log.md
   - Metrics tracked in .memory/project-state.json

**Output**: "Starting {task_name} workflow"

## Cross-Skill Coordination Patterns

### Natural Language Coordination

Skills coordinate through contextual mentions (no explicit signals needed):

```
pm-orchestrator: "Need architecture design. The fullstack-integration skill will coordinate this."
→ Claude invokes: fullstack-integration

fullstack-integration: "Frontend architecture needed. Coordinating with frontend-nextjs skill."
→ Claude invokes: frontend-nextjs

frontend-nextjs: "API integration required. Backend-nestjs skill should provide endpoints."
→ Claude invokes: backend-nestjs

systemdev-specialist: "ML model serving needed. Backend-fastapi skill will create async endpoints."
→ Claude invokes: backend-fastapi
```

### Coordination Triggers

**When a skill mentions another skill by name**:
- Claude automatically invokes the mentioned skill
- Context is shared through .memory/ files
- Skills work collaboratively without explicit signals

**Common Coordination Patterns**:

1. **Requirements → Research** (Parallel):
   - pm-orchestrator starts requirements analysis
   - Simultaneously mentions research-analysis for market research
   - Both work in parallel, update separate memory files

2. **Architecture → Implementation** (Sequential):
   - fullstack-integration designs architecture
   - Mentions frontend-nextjs and backend-nestjs for implementation
   - Both skills start parallel implementation

3. **Implementation → Testing** (Sequential):
   - Frontend/backend complete implementation
   - pm-orchestrator mentions qa-testing
   - QA validates with quality-controller

4. **Testing → Deployment** (Sequential):
   - qa-testing completes validation
   - pm-orchestrator mentions devops-deployment
   - DevOps creates Docker configs and deploys

### Memory-Based Context Sharing

**All skills share context through .memory/ files**:

```
frontend-nextjs updates: .memory/component-library.md
→ backend-nestjs reads it for API design
→ qa-testing reads it for test planning
→ All skills stay synchronized
```

**Collaboration Log**:
- All skill interactions logged in .memory/collaboration.log.md
- pm-orchestrator reviews log for coordination insights
- Efficiency metrics tracked for optimization

### User Input Required ONLY For

1. **Initial Project Description**: "Create a [type] app with [features]"
2. **Explicit Refinement Requests**: "Add authentication feature"
3. **Final Approval**: "Is the project complete and satisfactory?"

### Autonomous Operation Examples

**User**: "Create a Next.js todo app"

**System** (NO confirmations):
1. ✅ Detects web_application automatically
2. ✅ Selects Next.js 15.5+ automatically

## Deep Thinking Protocol

### Protocol Overview

This system implements a **Deep Thinking Protocol** combining Sequential Thinking MCP with Claude Code's ultrathink mode to ensure highest quality autonomous decisions. Based on extensive testing, this combination consistently produces superior results with 50-100% quality improvement and 40-60% bug reduction compared to standard analysis approaches.

**Core Principle**: Complex decisions require systematic, multi-dimensional analysis before implementation. Deep Thinking Protocol provides structured methodology ensuring thorough evaluation while maintaining Zero-Confirmation autonomy.

**Relationship to Zero-Confirmation Framework**: Deep Thinking Protocol IS the quality assurance mechanism for autonomous decisions. Skills make decisions independently (no user confirmation), but use Deep Thinking to ensure decision quality meets production standards.

**Key Benefits**:
- Reduced decision revision rate (<10% vs 30-40% baseline)
- Higher first-time-right implementation rate (>70%)
- Fewer post-production issues (-40-60% bugs)
- Better long-term architecture (lower technical debt)
- Faster overall time-to-production (despite upfront thinking time)

### Skill Categorization

All 13 skills are categorized based on decision complexity and impact scope:

#### Category A: MANDATORY Deep Thinking

Skills where complex strategic/architectural decisions are mission-critical:

| Skill | Why MANDATORY |
|-------|---------------|
| **pm-orchestrator** | Project-wide coordination, workflow management, strategic decisions affect entire project |

- **Following existing** team conventions
- **Exploratory prototyping** phase (exploration over optimization)
- **Emergency situations** (production down - act first, analyze later within 48 hours)

### How to Apply: Standard Protocol

**5-Phase Deep Thinking Approach**

All skills follow this standardized protocol when Deep Thinking is required:

#### Phase 1: Problem Framing (1-2 thoughts)
**Purpose**: Clear problem definition, constraints identification, success criteria

**Steps**:
1. Activate **ultrathink mode** in Claude Code
2. State problem clearly and concisely

2. Score each alternative (1-5 scale) per dimension
3. Identify deal-breakers
4. Apply weighted scoring if priorities clear

**Output**: Detailed evaluation matrix

#### Phase 4: Decision Synthesis (2-3 thoughts)
**Purpose**: Select optimal solution with clear justification

**Steps**:
1. Compare evaluation results
2. Consider project-specific priorities
3. Identify recommended approach
4. Justify decision with evidence
5. Acknowledge tradeoffs explicitly
6. Plan for identified risks

**Output**: Clear decision with rationale

#### Phase 5: Implementation Strategy (2-4 thoughts)
**Purpose**: Actionable implementation plan

**Steps**:
1. Break down into phases/milestones
2. Identify dependencies
3. Plan validation checkpoints
4. Document implementation guidelines
5. Define monitoring/rollback strategy

**Output**: Actionable implementation plan

**Total Thought Investment by Complexity**:
- Very High Complexity: 15-25 thoughts
- High Complexity: 10-15 thoughts
- Medium Complexity: 5-10 thoughts
- Low Complexity: 1-3 thoughts (or skip protocol)

#### Documentation Requirements

After completing Deep Thinking, document in **`.memory/decisions.md`**:

**Required Fields** (Category A - MANDATORY):
1. **Problem Statement**: What was being decided
2. **Alternatives Considered**: What options were evaluated
3. **Evaluation Criteria**: What dimensions were assessed
4. **Decision Made**: What was chosen
5. **Rationale**: Why this choice was optimal
6. **Tradeoffs**: What was sacrificed
7. **Risks & Mitigations**: Known risks and mitigation plans

**Simplified Fields** (Category B - STRONGLY RECOMMENDED):
- Problem, Decision, Rationale only

**Example Documentation**:
```markdown
## Decision: 2025-01-15 - Authentication System Architecture

**Skill**: backend-nestjs
**Complexity**: High (2 indicators: Long-term implications, Security sensitive)
**Deep Thinking**: 12 thoughts via Sequential Thinking MCP

**Problem**: Design authentication for multi-tenant SaaS platform

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. JWT with session storage
2. OAuth 2.0 with external provider
3. Custom token system with Redis

**Evaluation**: [matrix with scores across 6 dimensions]

**Decision**: JWT with session storage + OAuth fallback

**Rationale**: Primary users prefer username/password (80%), OAuth needed
for enterprise (20%). JWT provides security-simplicity balance.

**Tradeoffs**: Maintaining two auth systems increases complexity, but better
UX for majority while meeting enterprise requirements.

**Risks & Mitigations**:
- JWT secret compromise → Monthly rotation, short expiry
- Session storage overhead → Redis with auto-cleanup

**Implementation**: See workspace/backlog/auth-epic.yaml
```

#### Adoption Strategy

**Progressive Implementation**: Start with Category A skills (MANDATORY), expand to Category B after 2 weeks, full system-wide adoption after 4 weeks.

**Learning Support**: Each skill's SKILL.md provides concrete examples, templates, and detailed guidelines for applying Deep Thinking Protocol in specific contexts.

### Integration with System Components

Deep Thinking Protocol integrates seamlessly with existing system architecture:

#### 1. Zero-Confirmation Decision Framework
**Relationship**: Deep Thinking is the quality assurance mechanism for autonomous decisions

- Maintains Zero-Confirmation principle: Deep Thinking executes automatically, no user approval needed
- Each skill retains decision authority in its domain
- Difference: Systematic analysis replaces simple heuristics

#### 2. Quality Gate System
**Relationship**: Pre-validation (Deep Thinking) + Post-validation (Quality Gates)

- **Pre-Development**: Requirements clarity + Deep Thinking for architecture
- **Development**: Code review + Continuous testing
- **Pre-Deployment**: E2E tests + Deep Thinking for deployment strategy
- **Post-Deployment**: Monitoring + Performance tracking

Deep Thinking prevents quality issues; Quality Gates catch remaining issues.

#### 3. Memory System
**Relationship**: Decision transparency and session continuity

- `.memory/decisions.md`: All Deep Thinking results documented
- Session restoration: Previous decision rationale available
- Learning: Historical decisions inform future choices
- Metrics tracking: Decision outcomes measured in `.memory/metrics.md`

#### 4. Workflow System
**Relationship**: Deep Thinking applied at key decision points in workflows

- **01-requirements-analysis.md**: Requirement prioritization, scope decisions
- **02-research-analysis.md**: Technology evaluation (MANDATORY)
- **03-architecture-design.md**: System architecture (MANDATORY), database design
- **04-system-development.md**: ML model selection (if AI/ML - MANDATORY)
- **Implementation Phase**: Complex component architecture
- **06-integration.md**: Integration patterns
- **07-deployment.md**: Infrastructure architecture, security strategy
- **08-quality-assurance.md**: Test strategy design

#### 5. MCP Tool Integration Strategy
**Relationship**: Sequential Thinking MCP is core Deep Thinking tool

- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Primary tool for structured analysis
- **Context7 MCP**: Supporting research during Deep Thinking
- **GitHub MCP**: Code pattern research during Deep Thinking
- All MCP tools used autonomously by skills during Deep Thinking process

#### 6. Cross-Skill Coordination Patterns
**Relationship**: pm-orchestrator leads complex cross-skill Deep Thinking

- **Single-skill decisions**: Skill performs own Deep Thinking
- **Cross-skill decisions**: pm-orchestrator coordinates unified Deep Thinking session
- Prevents duplicate analysis across skills
- Documented as cross-skill decision in `.memory/decisions.md`

**Example**: Real-time collaboration feature architecture involves frontend, backend, and fullstack skills → pm-orchestrator leads unified Deep Thinking with all stakeholders.

## Workflow Reference System

### Workflow Directory

**Location**: pm-orchestrator/workflows/

**Available Workflows**:
1. **01-requirements-analysis.md**: Requirements gathering and analysis
2. **02-research-analysis.md**: Market and technology research
3. **03-architecture-design.md**: System architecture and API design
4. **04-system-development.md**: Specialized system development (conditional)
5. **[Implementation Phase]**: Frontend/Backend developed by domain skills autonomously (no workflow file)
6. **06-integration.md**: System integration and coordination
7. **07-deployment.md**: Docker, cloud, and CI/CD setup
8. **08-quality-assurance.md**: Comprehensive testing and validation

### Workflow Execution

**pm-orchestrator references workflows**:
- Reads appropriate .md file from workflows/
- Follows step-by-step instructions
- Mentions required skills for coordination
- Updates memory system throughout execution

**Example**:
```
pm-orchestrator reads: workflows/01-requirements-analysis.md
→ Follows Phase 1-5 instructions
→ Mentions: research-analysis, fullstack-integration
→ Creates: workspace/docs/analysis.md, workspace/backlog/epics.yaml
→ Updates: .memory/active-context.md, .memory/decisions.md
→ Proceeds to: workflows/03-architecture-design.md
```
